# MagicQ-Hotkeys
Keyboard shortcuts for Chamsys MagicQ using AutoHotKey.

Designed specifically for my own use so your mileage may vary. The shortcuts are inteded to speed up programming MagicQ on a single 1080p display with Capture as the visualiser. Since MagicQ doesn't have native keyboard shortcuts, these all rely on using AHK click commands with absolute click coordinates for each action (hence why it won't play nicely on other display sizes/multiple displays).

## Overview of Shortcuts
 * `Ctrl+F1` - Display quick reference
 * `F1-F3` - Layout 1-3
 * `F5-F8` - Group/Pos/Colour/Beam
 * `F9-F12` - Locate/Highlight/Single-All Toggle/Fan
 * `Insert` - Include
 * `Home` - Update
 * `PgUp` - Record
 * `Del` - Clear
 * `Ctrl+Del` - Remove
 * `End` - Set
 * `Caps Lock` - Enters/Exits "show mode" \*
 * `Ctrl+1-0` - Selects the active playback to run cues on (note that 0 is playback 10) \*
 * `Space/Right` - Active playback GO button \*
 * `Ctrl+Space/Left` - Active playback Pause button \*
 * `Tab` - Quickly switches between MagicQ and Capture windows \*
 * `Shift+Tab` - Quickly splits/unslipts MagicQ and Capture \*

\*These shortcuts work while Capture is focussed aswell; all other shortcuts require MagicQ to be focussed AND maximized.
